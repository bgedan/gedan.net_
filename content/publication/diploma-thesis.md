abstract = "Diploma Thesis. The given task was to develop a control scheme for an induction machine as a driving solution for an electric vehicle. The developed software has been build in a modular approach. A software-environment has been developed in which the control scheme has ben embedded. Furthermore a limitation of DC-Voltage has been implemented to safeguard the batteries. An repetative evaluation at the existing test bench was done. The developed software, the used tools, the simukation model and the evaluation of the developed software is being presented."
