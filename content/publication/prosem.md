abstract = "Method to compare the speed and the accuracy of the training algorithms of Suport Vector Machines (SVM) and Local Linear Model Trees (LOLIMOT) with the OLS-algorithm for Radial Basis Function Networks(RBF) a RBF network and a GUI in  MATLAB and a MEX-interface  in  C  were  developed. The  thereby  designed  toolbox provides  simple means to compare the performance of the different methods. Testcases were provided by a classification and a regression problem from the field of internal combustion engines"
